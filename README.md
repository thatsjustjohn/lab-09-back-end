Overview
As a user, I want to enter the name of a location so that I do not need to look up the latitude and longitude every time I learn about a new location.

As a user, I want to request current weather information so that I can learn more about the typical weather patterns in the location.

As a user, I want to request current event information so that I can learn more about the events going on in the location.

As a user, I want clear messages if something goes wrong so I know if I need to make any changes or try again in a different manner.
